# **App Name**: PurinePilot

## Core Features:

- Content Search: Implement a search feature that allows users to search for food items based on keywords and return purine content levels. Use an LLM tool to determine which of the food items may match search context best. This helps in accommodating potential user typos. Use data from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TVQRrJz4rnZ8B6N54B13yLneJ-ZY0O7Y/view?usp=drivesdk
- Filtered Food List: Display a list of food items filtered by their purine content, with options for users to specify the desired purine level (low, medium, high).
- Detailed Food View: When a user selects a food item, display detailed information including purine content, serving size, and other relevant nutritional data.
- Gout Information: Provide educational content related to gout, including causes, symptoms, and dietary recommendations.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, desaturated blue (#A7C4D7) to evoke a sense of calmness and health. It aligns with the goal of managing gout through diet.
- Background color: Very light, almost white blue (#F0F4F7). It should be visually of the same hue as the primary color.
- Accent color: Muted green (#8FBC8F) for positive dietary suggestions and calls to action. Green evokes the idea of 'healthy foods'.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines. Space Grotesk will give the application a bit of techy feel while inter offers great readability
- Use clear, minimalist icons to represent food categories and dietary information.
- A clean, well-organized layout with clear sections for search, filters, and food lists.
- Subtle transitions and animations for a smooth user experience when filtering and displaying content.
